//first: check that all lengths are > 0
  //can use a array method
  //if not then return 'invalid'
//second: sort the array and check that
  //small side 1 + small side 2 > long side
    //else return 'invalid'

//equilateral test is easy
  //first number === second
  //second === third

//isosceles
    //check all possible "two" combination equality

//scalene
  //else isoceles


//we can just use bunch of if conditions without any nesting
