//we are counting empty spaces
//start a new object with the keys: lowercase, uppercase, neither
//split the word into charcters
//each time we encounter one of the cases as per keys, increment their count by 1
//then at the end change the counter of each keys to (total count / length of string) * 100 and
  //use 2 decimal places

//once I finish the regex book, use regex for this problem
