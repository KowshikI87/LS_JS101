//need to know regex to count all instance of a charcter


//we get a number. 
//number % 7 ==> lowest number below this number that is a factor of 7
//then us a while loop to get next number (7 * factor + 1)
  //keep doing this till we get a number
    //that is odd
    //and none of the digit is a duplicate
      //convert to a string
        //go through each character and see that none of them appears more than once
          //could use array methods to do this but want to do it with regex
        //if they do then return false
        //else return true
